# Movie-search-project
This is a simple web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API, add them to their favorites list, and filter the favorites list. The application uses local storage to save the user's favorite movies so that the data persists even after a page refresh.

## Features
-Search Movies: Users can search for movies by title and filter them by genre.
-Add to Favorites: Users can add movies to their favorites list.
-Edit Favorites: Users can edit the title of a movie in their favorites list.
-Remove from Favorites: Users can remove movies from their favorites list.
-Filter Favorites: Users can filter their favorite movies by title.
-Persistent Data: The favorites list is saved in local storage, so it persists across page reloads.
-Notifications: Displays notifications for actions like adding/removing movies, and search results.

## Technologies Used
-HTML5: Markup language for the structure of the web pages.
-CSS3: Styling for the app.
-JavaScript: Logic for interacting with the OMDb API, handling user inputs, and updating the UI.
-OMDb API: An external API used to search for movies and fetch movie details.
